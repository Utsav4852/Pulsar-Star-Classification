# Pulsar-Star-Classification

Pulsars are a rare type of Neutro star that produces radio detectable here on Earth. They are of considerable scientific interest as probes of space-time, the interstellar medium, and states of matter. Machine learning tools are now being used to automatically label pulsar candidates to facilitate rapid analysis. Classification systems in particular are being widely adopted, which treat the candidate data sets as binary classification problems.

In the recent Kaggle Tabular competition series, I came across this classification with some challenging work here. In this classification competition, the biggest challenge was the log loss evaluation.
